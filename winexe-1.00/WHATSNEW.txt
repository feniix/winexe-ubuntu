                   Release Notes for Samba 3.4.0pre1

                   =================================

This is the first preview release of Samba 3.4.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Major enhancements in Samba 3.4.0 include:

Authentication Changes:
o Changed the way smbd handles untrusted domain names given during user
  authentication

Authentication Changes
======================

Previously, when Samba was a domain member and a client was connecting using an
untrusted domain name, such as BOGUS\user smbd would remap the untrusted
domain to the primary domain smbd was a member of and attempt authentication
using that DOMAIN\user name.  This differed from how a Windows member server
would behave.  Now, smbd will replace the BOGUS name with it's SAM name.  In
the case where smbd is acting as a PDC this will be DOMAIN\user.  In the case
where smbd is acting as a domain member server this will be WORKSTATION\user.
Thus, smbd will never assume that an incoming user name which is not qualified
with the same primary domain, is part of smbd's primary domain.

While this behavior matches Windows, it may break some workflows which depended
on smbd to always pass through bogus names to the DC for verification.  A new
parameter "map untrusted to domain" can be enabled to revert to the legacy
behavior.
